This is one of the projects I built during the WesBos JS 30 Day Course. By pressing start the moles pop up at random intervals. Try to whack as much of them
as you can.

### What I learned

As per the usual more practise with writing functions, the moles pop up at random times between 200 ms and 2 sec, also the hole the moles pop up from are random.

### Continued development

Next projects should be a few from FrontEnd mentor.
